## Computing average response time of a verified, working solution for a question asked on StackOverflow.

Stack Overflow is a huge database of Questions and Answers and it really helps in finding answers related to the various topics of Computer Science. However, Stack Overflow provides no means of expecting how soon a user can expect an answer as that is highly dependent on the nature and commonality of tags in his question and how popular is that tag with the users, because naturally a follows stringent quality tests of Questions asked, meaning off-topic questions, or questions which are similar to ones already asked (redundant) will be removed or closed very quickly. So in order to help a user know the time he/she would have to wait to get an answer we thought of using data analytics in finding detecting the quality and also estimate how soon he/she would get an answer.

We have analysed the data from the 2008 stack overflow data dump and have(based on the attribute values of the cleaned data) predicted the time required by a user (who posted a question based on certain tags) to expect an answer. We have used Linear regression to analyse. Please read the report.doc to know the details of the project.

new.csv contains the StackOveflow data using which further calculations are made to compute average time of getting answer.
